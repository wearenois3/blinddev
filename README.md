# _blindDev(*); starter package

This is a starter package to getting challenge yourselves and the other teams.

After cloning this **repo** you’ll just need to run 

> npm install

from your favorite CLI and then you will need to run

> gulp

to get auto compiling started. But only your audience is going to see it!

## What is _blindDev(*);

There was a time when inspect element didn’t mean a thing. A time when compiling was the last step of coding. Now we have live reload, hot compiling. New stuff. Easy stuff.

We forgot how this whole thing of frontend development worked, for real. When this was painful.

Blind Dev is a challenge that answer this question: how difficult was this.

## How the _blindDev(*); challenge works

You’re going to run in two teams (2 people each) and you’ll be given a visual layout to reproduce in code but you won’t be able to see the result of your coding.
One person per turn will be coding and the remaining one will only see the result: each turn people will be called to code HTML / SCSS / JS.

There are going to be 2 steps: the first 15 minutes are needed to build structure and main visuals of the page (you’ll have either Foundation or Bootstrap as Frameworks), then you’ll have a 5 minutes break with open discussion with the public to talk about their opinion about the results and then again other 15 minutes for fixing stuff.

Compiling will be the last step. Again.
You win if there are no errors. Any warning or mistake and you're done byebye
